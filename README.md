# Felipe's Place

## 🧑‍💻 Overview
Hello! My name is Felipe, and I've been passionate about computing, technology, and the English language since childhood. These interests have shaped my choices, leading to extensive knowledge in systems, hardware, and electronics.

In 2019, I began a bachelor's degree in computer engineering. I'm driven by a love for learning, mastering new technologies, and solving challenges independently. My approach to learning emphasizes building a strong foundation before diving into creation.  
I started in programming by learning C and C++ for object-oriented programming (OOP). I strongly recommend this approach to beginners as it provides a solid foundation in understanding memory management, optimizing code, and defining data types effectively.
Throughout my professional journey, I have gained hands-on experience in infrastructure, working closely with Cisco devices, bare-metal environments, and virtualization technologies. These experiences have significantly influenced my approach as a developer, instilling in me a deep appreciation for performance optimization, network efficiency, and security best practices. Moreover, It's satisfying to understand the broader context and be able to add depth when crafting the smaller details.
